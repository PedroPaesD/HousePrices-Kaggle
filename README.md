# House Prices Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses the classic [House Prices dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) to predict home sale prices based on various property features. The repository includes a Python script for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the final sale prices of houses based on numerous features, such as lot area, quality, and condition. Using the data provided by Kaggle, we apply data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and train several regression models.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found on the [Kaggle House Prices competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Download `train.csv` and `test.csv` and place them in the project directory.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-prices-prediction.git
cd house-prices-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Main Libraries
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Usage
Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the same directory as `houseprice.py`. To run the script:

```bash
python houseprice.py
```

## Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
1. **Missing Value Handling**: We remove features with excessive missing values, such as `Alley`, `Fence`, `MiscFeature`, `MasVnrType`, and `PoolQC`.
2. **NaN Substitution**: Features like `LotFrontage`, `MasVnrArea`, and `GarageYrBlt` are filled with mean values, while `Electrical` and `FireplaceQu` are filled with specific categorical values.
3. **Basement and Garage Features**: New features `BsmtFinal` and `GrgFinal` are created based on quality and condition of basement and garage, respectively. This consolidates relevant information and removes original basement and garage condition features.
4. **Normalization**: Selected features are normalized by dividing by their maximum values to improve model performance.

## Modeling
Two main models are used for predicting house prices:
1. **Ridge Regression**: Trained with a regularization parameter (`alpha=3.2`) on a 50% split of the training data.
2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Trained with the default settings, and predictions are made on the test set.

### Chosen Features
The script uses the following features for modeling:
- `MSSubClass`, `LotFrontage`, `LotArea`, `OverallQual`, `OverallCond`, `MasVnrArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `MoSold`, `BsmtFinal`, `GrgFinal`, `YrSold`

### Output
The final predictions are saved in a CSV file, `sublinreg.csv`, containing columns `Id` and `SalePrice`, ready for submission to Kaggle.

## Results
The modelâ€™s performance can be evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared. Uncommenting the RMSE and R-squared lines in the script will display these values for the model on the test set.
